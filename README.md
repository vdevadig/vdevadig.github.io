# About Me
<p style="text-align:justify;color:black">Hey there! I'm Vaishnavi Shankar Devadig. Fueled by caffeine and code, I’m currently navigating the thrilling rapids of my Master's degree in Data Science. Some might call me inquisitive, others might even say I have a talent for turning intrusive thoughts into insightful questions. Hey, whatever gets the job done, right? Like the 95% confidence interval I calculated on my ability to make awkward jokes – statistically significant; although the jury's still out on whether they're funny. Regardless, I'm here to learn, experiment, and push the boundaries of what data can tell us, even if it means asking the questions no one else dares to voice. After all, as the saying goes, correlation doesn't imply causation, but it can definitely lead to some fascinating conversations! So bring on the data, the discussions, and maybe even a few groan-worthy puns. I'm ready to dive in, right from the basics all the way up to the bigger boats! </p>

<h2 style="color:black;text-align:justify">Education</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;color:black;"><b>Data Science, Masters</b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;color:black;">Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;color:black"> Currently, conducting research on a <b>novel Tag-aware Recommender System (TRS)</b> under the guidance of Professor Yong Zheng at the Illinois Institute of Technology. This project explores the <b>integration of both social tagging and contextual information as tags</b> within the recommendation process.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;color:black">Our focus is on generating highly specific item recommendations for individual users based on the combination of their user profile and associated tags, rather than generic top-k recommendations. This necessitates the <b>development of novel evaluation metrics and relevancy measures that specifically consider the user-tag combination, moving beyond solely user-centric approaches.</b></p>
