# About Me
<p style="text-align:justify;color:black">Hey there! I am Vaishnavi Shankar Devadig, fueled by caffeine, cloud clusters, and just the right amount of SQL. By day (and sometimes by late night), I am navigating the mind boggling rapids of my full time job as a Data Engineer. Some say I am inquisitive, others say I have turned my intrusive thoughts into optimized queries, and hey, whatever gets the job done, right?
For me, data engineering isnâ€™t just about pipelines, it is about architecting reliable systems, wrangling messy datasets into shape, and making sure downstream analysts, scientists, and applications can trust what flows their way. Whether it is debugging a stubborn Spark job, designing scalable architectures, or questioning why a single column has five different definitions across teams, I am here to engineer clarity out of chaos.</p>
  
<p style="text-align:justify;color:black">That being said, I am not just content moving data, I like exploring what happens once the pipelines deliver it as well. Experimenting with ML models, dabbling in feature engineering, and translating raw numbers into insights keeps things exciting. After all, correlation may not imply causation, but it does spark fascinating questions at the intersection of engineering and data science.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;color:black">So bring on the data lakes, plumbing, deltas, and discussions, I am ready to dive deep, from the nitty-gritty of ingestion jobs all the way to machine learning experiments riding on top of those bigger boats!</p>
